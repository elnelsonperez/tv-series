## Movies and TV Shows Database

A project built using Create React App and [The Movie DB](https://www.themoviedb.org) to tinker with:
- React with Typescript 
- React Hooks (Built in and custom)
- Redux
- [redux-observable](https://redux-observable.js.org/)
- RxJs

**The UI is simple and is not the focus of the project** 

My aim was to avoid using `any` in Typescript and to apply good practices in the React ecosystem.
